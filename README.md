# **VBA_Challenge: The VBA of Wall Street**
--------------- 

## Summary

Visual Basic Applications (VBA) script loops through three years of stock price data for several companies to calculate metrics like total volume, annual change in dollar value, and annual percentage change in dollar value for each of the stocks across all three years. Also, the script locates the stocks with the greatest annual percentage increases in value, greatest annual percentage decreases in value, and greatest total annual volumes. 

## Stock Market Analysis Instructions by Level of Difficulty

## *Easy* 
* Create a script that loops through each year of stock data and counts the total amount of volume each stock had over the year.
* Create a script that displays the ticker symbol that coincides with the total volume.

## *Moderate* 
* Create a script that loops through all the stocks and calculates the following information:
  * The yearly change from what the stock opened the year at to what the closing price was
  * The percent change from the what it opened the year at to what it closed
  * The total Volume of the stock
  * Ticker symbol
  * Use conditional formatting to highlight the positive change in green and negative change in red

## *Hard* 
* Include the information from the moderate challenge
* Locate the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % Decrease" and "Greatest total volume"

## *Challenge*
* Make the appropriate adjustments to your script that will allow it to run on every worksheet just by running it once.
